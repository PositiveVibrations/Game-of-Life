# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This implementation provides a graphical visualization using Pygame, allowing users to interact with the grid to set initial conditions and observe the evolution of the system.

## Overview

This Python implementation of the Game of Life offers a visual and interactive way to explore Conway's famous cellular automaton. Using the Pygame library, it features a dynamic grid where users can activate/deactivate cells to see how they evolve over time according to a set of rules.

## Demo

## Key Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Click to activate or deactivate cells.
- **Control Simulation:** Start, pause, and reset the simulation at any time.
- **Adjustable Grid Size:** Easily modify the size of the grid directly in the code.
- **Real-time Updates:** Watch the cells evolve in real-time based on the game's rules.

## Getting Started

Python 3.12.1
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch the application using `python life.py`.

## Usage Instructions

- **Set Initial Conditions:** Click on the grid cells to toggle them between alive and dead states.
- **Start Simulation:** Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- **Pause Simulation:** Click the "Pause" button to pause the simulation at its current state.
- **Reset Simulation:** Click the "Restart" button to clear the grid and start anew.
